# Bootstrap Blog Page  
A simple blog web application that was made using HTML, CSS & JS (mainy Bootstrap) and Python Flask.  
The web app consists of three pages: home, about and contact.  
The home page contains posts and social media links. The about page - information about the creator of blog page. The contact page contains contact form.   

#### You may replace the information on the blog page with your own.  
#### To replace posts' information use [API NPoint IO](https://www.npoint.io/).  
The structure of the JSON bin should be:
